# Advent of Code - Day 06 :boat: :checkered_flag:

Welcome to the 6th day of Advent of Code! Today's challenge involves a boat race where you need to travel as far as you can within a fixed amount of time. The boats are toy boats, each with a big button on top. Holding down the button charges the boat, and releasing the button allows the boat to move. Boats move faster if their button was held longer, but time spent holding the button counts against the total race time. You can only hold the button at the start of the race, and boats don't move until the button is released. :sailboat: :dash:

The goal is to go farther in each race than the current record holder. :trophy:
