# Advent of Code - Day 01

## Puzzle Summary

Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have given you a map with stars marking the top fifty locations likely to be having problems. To restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

The Elves are already loading you into a trebuchet to send you to the sky. As they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input) has been amended by a very young Elf who was just excited to show off her art skills. Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the document.

The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.

## Contents

- `input.txt`: This text document contains the puzzle data for Day 01.
- `01a.py`: This Python script contains the solution for the first part of the puzzle.
- `01b.py`: This Python script contains the solution for the second part of the puzzle.

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the Python scripts using the command: `python 01a.py` or `python 01b.py`
3. The scripts read the puzzle data from `input.txt` and print the solution.
