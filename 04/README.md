# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code - Day 4 :christmas_tree:

This folder contains the solutions for the 4th day of the Advent of Code. The puzzle for the day was about helping an Elf :elf: with a pile of colorful square cards :black_joker:. Each card has two lists of numbers separated by a vertical bar (|): a list of winning numbers and then a list of numbers you have. The goal is to figure out which of the numbers you have appear in the list of winning numbers.

## :file_folder: Files

- `04a.py`: This Python script contains the solution for part A of the puzzle. It calculates the number of matches between the winning numbers and the numbers you have for each card.

- `04b.py`: This Python script contains the solution for part B of the puzzle. It calculates the number of copies of scratchcards you win based on the number of matches.

- `input.txt`: This file contains the puzzle input, which is a table of the numbers on the scratchcards.

- `testInputA.txt`: This file contains example input for part A of the puzzle.

- `testInputB.txt`: This file contains example input for part B of the puzzle.

## :rocket: Running the Scripts

First, navigate to the "04" directory:

```bash
cd 04
```

Then you can run the scripts using Python 3 as follows:

```bash
python3 04a.py
python3 04b.py
```

This will print the solutions for parts A and B of the puzzle, respectively. :tada:
